# Double Click

In <code>src/components/App.js</code>, we have a button with id="dblclick-btn"
and a function <code>handleDoubleClick</code>, write code inside handleDoubleClick and attach it to a 
appropriate event listener on button such that when user double clicks on button
it prints to console, "I was double clicked" else it displays "I was not double clicked"
